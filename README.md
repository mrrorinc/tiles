# tiles

The 'tiles' project is a social micro-publishing platform prototype developed in AngularJS and Node.js. A social network for inspirations - 'tiles' allows you to post bite-size content of images, text and link to your feed and share it with your friends. Streams may be shared on their own, or users may follow other publishers and receive an ever-changing stream of social inspiration.

The real purpose of this project is experimental and educational. Goals are

- to showcase the exceptional productivity of developing on the MEAN stack
- to seek, test, discuss and share best practices
- to provide a real-life like example of Angular and Node based apps

This is the web client implementation for 'tiles' on AngularJS 1.3. The counterpart of the client is the [RESFUL API SERVER](https://github.com/mrrorinc/tiles).

PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS PROJECT IS AN EXPERIMENTAL PROTOTYPE, NOT PRODUCTION CODE. FUNCTIONALITY MAY BE INCOMPLETE OR CHANGING.
